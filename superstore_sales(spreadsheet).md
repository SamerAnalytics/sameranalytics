## Spreadsheet Project - Superstore Sales Data Analysis

Welcome to my Superstore Sales Data Analysis project! In this project, I will showcase my expertise in using **Google Sheets** and **Excel** for data analysis and visualization. The dataset I am working with is the **Superstore Sales dataset**, which contains detailed sales transactions, customer information, and product data from a retail store.

### Project Goals:

- **Data Cleaning**: Preparing and cleaning the dataset to ensure accurate analysis and ensuring the data is free from biases that could impact the results.
- **Data Analysis**: Identifying key trends, patterns, and insights in the sales data.
- **Visualization**: Creating dynamic and insightful visualizations, including charts, graphs, and pivot tables, to highlight sales performance, product categories, and customer behaviors.
- **Advanced Spreadsheet Functions**: Demonstrating my proficiency with functions like `VLOOKUP`, `SUMIFS`, conditional formatting, and data validation to make the analysis more efficient and insightful.

As I continue to work on this project, I will be updating my progress regularly and showcasing new techniques and analyses that I apply to this dataset.

This screenshot provides a snapshot of the data Iâ€™m working with, though some columns (such as Product Subcategory, Product Name, Product Container, Product Base Margin, and Ship Date) are not visible here. These columns will be explored in more detail in later stages of the analysis.

Before diving into the analysis, I applied a filter to ensure the data was clean and consistent. This involved removing duplicates, ensuring case sensitivity, and validating the integrity of the dataset. With the data now properly cleaned, we can proceed with the analysis.
