## Spreadsheet Project - Superstore Sales Data Analysis

Welcome to my Superstore Sales Data Analysis project! In this project, I will showcase my expertise in using **Google Sheets** and **Excel** for data analysis and visualization. The dataset I am working with is the **Superstore Sales dataset**, which contains detailed sales transactions, customer information, and product data from a retail store.

### Project Goals:

- **Data Cleaning**: Preparing and cleaning the dataset to ensure accurate analysis and ensuring the data is free from biases that could impact the results.
- **Data Analysis**: Identifying key trends, patterns, and insights in the sales data.
- **Visualization**: Creating dynamic and insightful visualizations, including charts, graphs, and pivot tables, to highlight sales performance, product categories, and customer behaviors.
- **Advanced Spreadsheet Functions**: Demonstrating my proficiency with functions like `VLOOKUP`, `SUMIFS`, conditional formatting, and data validation to make the analysis more efficient and insightful.

As I continue to work on this project, I will be updating my progress regularly and showcasing new techniques and analyses that I apply to this dataset.
