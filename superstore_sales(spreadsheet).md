## Spreadsheet Project - Superstore Sales Data Analysis

Welcome to my Superstore Sales Data Analysis project! In this project, I will showcase my expertise in using **Google Sheets** and **Excel** for data analysis and visualization. The dataset I am working with is the **Superstore Sales dataset**, which contains detailed sales transactions, customer information, and product data from a retail store.

### Project Goals:

- **Data Cleaning**: Preparing and cleaning the dataset to ensure accurate analysis and ensuring the data is free from biases that could impact the results.
- **Data Analysis**: Identifying key trends, patterns, and insights in the sales data.
- **Visualization**: Creating dynamic and insightful visualizations, including charts, graphs, and pivot tables, to highlight sales performance, product categories, and customer behaviors.
- **Advanced Spreadsheet Functions**: Demonstrating my proficiency with functions like `VLOOKUP`, `SUMIFS`, conditional formatting, and data validation to make the analysis more efficient and insightful.

As I continue to work on this project, I will be updating my progress regularly and showcasing new techniques and analyses that I apply to this dataset.

This screenshot provides a snapshot of the data I’m working with, though some columns (such as Product Subcategory, Product Name, Product Container, Product Base Margin, and Ship Date) are not visible here. These columns will be explored in more detail in later stages of the analysis.

Before diving into the analysis, I applied a filter to ensure the data was clean and consistent. This involved removing duplicates, ensuring case sensitivity, and validating the integrity of the dataset. With the data now properly cleaned, we can proceed with the analysis.

### Pivot Table: Total Sales by Product Category

In this pivot table, I’ve grouped the data by **Product Category** and calculated the **SUM of Total Sales** for each category. This analysis provides a clear overview of how sales are distributed across different product categories.

Here are the key insights from the pivot table:

- **Technology** had the highest total sales, amounting to **$5,693,015.06**.
- **Furniture** generated **$4,933,871.76** in total sales.
- **Office Supplies** contributed **$3,566,696.94** to the total sales.

The **Grand Total** sales amount to **$14,193,583.76**, which represents the overall revenue generated from all product categories in the dataset.

This pivot table helps us understand the performance of each product category, identifying the top-performing categories and the areas where the business has seen the most sales.

### Pivot Table: Total Sales by Product Subcategory

In this pivot table, I’ve grouped the data by **Product Subcategory** and calculated the **SUM of Total Sales** for each subcategory. This allows for a more detailed breakdown of sales within the broader product categories.

Here are the key insights from the pivot table:

- **Office Machines** had the highest total sales, amounting to **$2,063,925.38**.
- **Tables** followed closely behind, generating **$1,802,418.27** in total sales.
- **Chairs & Chairmats** contributed **$1,677,969.10** to the total sales, making it one of the top-performing subcategories.

On the lower end, **Rubber Bands** had the smallest sales, with only **$14,268.83** in total sales.

The **Grand Total** sales amount to **$14,193,583.76**, which represents the overall revenue generated from all product subcategories.

This pivot table provides a granular view of how sales are distributed among individual product subcategories, helping to pinpoint high-performing products and identify areas where sales may be lower.

**Why it’s useful**:  
By breaking down sales at the subcategory level, this analysis helps businesses understand which specific products are driving revenue and which may need further attention in terms of marketing or inventory. It also helps in forecasting demand for individual products.
